With playboi, you can currently play Truth or Dare as well as Would You Rather.
Additionally, simple commands like Roll Dice are available as well.

If you liked this, check out [Olevenbaum's](https://github.com/Olevenbaum "Olevenbaum") amazing bot [Dark-Olevenbaum](https://github.com/Olevenbaum/Dark-Olevenbaum "Dark-Olevenbaum"). A bot that is mediocre at best and very concerning in the worst case, is [Mo-Bot](https://github.com/bit-burger/MoBot "disgusting"). Despite my dislike against this bot, and playboi clearly being better than Mo, [bit-burger](https://github.com/bit-burger "bit-burger") is a great developer, who you should definitely check out as well.
